# Free Your Self

Free Your Self is a simple static website that FLOSS developers can customize
and use to receive donations for their work. It supports many different
ways to receive donations. Currently these methods are supported:

* Bitcoin
* Dwolla
* PayPal

Methods which are currently being worked on:

* Amazon Payments
* Google Checkout
* Flattr

If you have another way in which you would like to receive donations, please
let us know!

# Why?

The more possible methods of easily and conveniently donating, the higher the
chance of getting a donation.

# How To Deploy Your Tip Jar

Free Your Self is designed to be extremely simple to deploy to Github. To deploy
your Free Your Self instance:

* Create a Github account if you don't already have one
* Fork Free Your Self on github
* Modify the _config.yml file and put in your information. Only donation methods
that you configure will show up on your Free Your Self website.
* Commit your changes and push the new commit to your fork.
* Your new Free Your Self website will show up at https://USER.github.com/freeyourself .
It will take about 10 minutes for it to show up the first time, but after that the website
will be updated within a few seconds after each push.
